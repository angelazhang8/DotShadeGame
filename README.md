# Dot-Shade-Game

Ever played Arg.io or Slither.io? This game is similar except when you consume a dot, your player character's RGB values average out with the dot's RGB values. The objective of the game is to match your PC's colour to the screen background.

## Instructions on how to play:
1.	Use arrow keys to move
2.	Try to consume dots that will help you achieve a colour that matches the background, there is some leeway because matching exact RGB values would be a ridiculous requirement
3.	Happy gaming!
